Documentation
Introduction
Welcome to the Technical Take Home Exam Documentation! This documentation serves as a comprehensive guide for Task 3 of the technical exam.

The web application integrates various APIs to provide a comprehensive tool for assessing fire pathways and determining the average kWh residential utility rate for a given location.

This documentation will showcase the Python Flask application and discuss the implementation details, including the use of OOP principles and the integration of the APIs. We will explain how the application takes an address input, retrieves relevant information, and presents the results.
